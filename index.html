            When a project feels complex, a second opinion helps. This service provides
            independent advisory guidance for homeowners and small contractors—focused on
            clarity, options, and practical next steps. It is not inspection, certification,
            approval, or a guarantee of outcomes.

          <p>
            This service is designed for decisions that feel "too important to guess." With
            30+ years of construction and kitchen experience, the goal is to provide a calm,

          <p>
            Guidance is offered in writing, with options and limitations clearly stated so
            you can move forward confidently with your own team.
