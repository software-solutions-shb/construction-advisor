## Summary of the situation
The client is planning a 10x12 kitchen with a range and an island and wants to confirm the layout is workable.

## Key considerations
- Clearance around the island and major appliance doors
- Ventilation routing and ceiling height
- Workflow between sink, range, and refrigerator

## Options and trade-offs
- Smaller island to improve circulation
- Shifting the range to allow better prep space
- Prioritizing storage over seating

## Suggested next steps
- Confirm clearances against manufacturer specs
- Share a scaled plan view with dimensions
- Validate vent path with the installer

This is general advisory guidance based on the information provided. It does not replace on-site inspection, engineering, permitting, or legal advice.

## Assumptions
- The space dimensions are accurate and measured wall-to-wall.
- Appliances are standard depth unless noted otherwise.

## Escalation notes
- If structural changes are involved, consult a licensed engineer or local building official.
