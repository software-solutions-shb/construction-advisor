## Summary of the situation
You want to install a tile backsplash over painted drywall near a sink and are concerned about moisture.

## Key considerations
- Moisture exposure and splash frequency
- Adhesion to existing paint and surface prep
- Local code or manufacturer requirements for wet areas

## Options and trade-offs
- Install over properly prepped drywall with suitable adhesive if moisture is minimal
- Use a moisture-resistant backer in areas with frequent water exposure

## Suggested next steps
- Check tile adhesive recommendations for painted surfaces
- Lightly sand and clean the wall to improve bond
- Consider a backer upgrade if the sink area gets heavy splash

## Boundaries disclaimer
This is general advisory guidance based on the information provided. It does not replace on-site inspection, engineering, permitting, or legal advice.

## Assumptions
- The drywall is sound, flat, and free of damage.
- This is a standard residential sink area, not a shower or commercial kitchen.

## Escalation notes
- If there is active moisture intrusion or mold, consult a remediation professional.
