## Summary of the situation
You’re planning a 10x12 kitchen with an island and want to confirm that circulation clearances are adequate.

## Key considerations
- Minimum clearance for walkways around the island
- Appliance door swings and drawers
- Primary work zones between sink, range, and refrigerator

## Options and trade-offs
- Reduce island depth to improve circulation
- Shift appliance locations to avoid door conflicts
- Prioritize storage over seating if space is tight

## Suggested next steps
- Provide a scaled plan with exact aisle widths
- Confirm appliance dimensions from manufacturer specs
- Identify the busiest path and ensure it remains clear

## Assumptions

- Appliances are standard depth.

## Escalation notes
