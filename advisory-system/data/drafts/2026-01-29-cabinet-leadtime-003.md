## Summary of the situation
Your cabinet delivery is delayed, and you want guidance on how to adjust the remodel timeline.

## Key considerations
- Dependencies between cabinets, countertops, plumbing, and electrical trim
- Temporary protection for finished floors
- Storage and staging for delayed materials

## Options and trade-offs
- Pause finish work to avoid rework, but extend project duration
- Proceed with non-dependent tasks (painting, flooring) with careful protection
- Re-sequence trades to avoid idle time where possible

## Suggested next steps
- Ask the cabinet supplier for a firm delivery window and tracking updates
- Rebuild the schedule with contractor input and confirm critical path items
- Document any agreed changes to scope or timing in writing

## Boundaries disclaimer
This is general advisory guidance based on the information provided. It does not replace on-site inspection, engineering, permitting, or legal advice.

## Assumptions
- Countertops are dependent on cabinet installation.
- The project is residential and not under a commercial deadline.

## Escalation notes
- If delays trigger contract penalties or disputes, consult a local attorney.
