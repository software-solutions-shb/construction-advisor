## Summary of the situation
You’re planning a range hood with a roughly 20-foot duct run and want to know if that’s acceptable and whether flexible duct is appropriate.

## Key considerations
- Duct length, elbows, and total equivalent run
- Manufacturer requirements for duct type and size
- Noise and performance trade-offs

## Options and trade-offs
- Use rigid ducting to improve airflow and reduce noise
- Shorten the run or reduce elbows if possible
- Choose a hood rated for longer runs if the route can’t be changed

## Suggested next steps
- Review the hood manufacturer’s maximum duct length and elbow limits
- Map the route with number and type of elbows
- Ask the installer to confirm equivalent length calculations

## Boundaries disclaimer
This is general advisory guidance based on the information provided. It does not replace on-site inspection, engineering, permitting, or legal advice.

## Assumptions
- The hood will be vented outdoors, not recirculating.
- Standard residential installation.

## Escalation notes
- If local code requires specific duct materials or fire ratings, consult your local building department.
