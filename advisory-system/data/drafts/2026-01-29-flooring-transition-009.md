## Summary of the situation
You’re installing LVP next to tile and want to know if an expansion gap is needed at the transition.

## Key considerations
- LVP floating floor expansion requirements
- Transition strip type and movement allowance
- Humidity and temperature changes in the space

## Options and trade-offs
- Use a transition profile that allows movement while covering the gap
- Reduce movement risk by maintaining consistent indoor humidity

## Suggested next steps
- Confirm the manufacturer’s expansion gap requirements
- Choose a transition strip designed for floating floors
- Ensure the LVP isn’t pinned by cabinets or trim

## Boundaries disclaimer
This is general advisory guidance based on the information provided. It does not replace on-site inspection, engineering, permitting, or legal advice.

## Assumptions
- The LVP is a floating installation.
- The tile is already set and stable.

## Escalation notes
- If moisture is present under the floor, consult a flooring professional for remediation guidance.
