## Summary of the situation
You’re comparing quartz and granite countertops and want a durability and maintenance perspective.

## Key considerations
- Heat and scratch resistance expectations
- Stain resistance and sealing requirements
- Consistency of appearance and seam placement

## Options and trade-offs
- Quartz: generally lower maintenance, consistent appearance, but heat sensitivity varies by brand
- Granite: natural stone with good heat tolerance, but usually requires periodic sealing

## Suggested next steps
- Ask fabricators about warranty exclusions and care requirements
- Request slab samples and check finish options
- Confirm edge profile and seam locations before ordering

## Boundaries disclaimer
This is general advisory guidance based on the information provided. It does not replace on-site inspection, engineering, permitting, or legal advice.

## Assumptions
- Normal residential use and typical cleaning practices.
- No commercial-grade heat or cutting activity.

## Escalation notes
- If you need certified food-safety or commercial compliance, consult the manufacturer and local code requirements.


## cost effective, contractors point of view, quartz over granite, unless client wants otherwise.
