## Summary of the situation
You were expecting electrical work to be included, but your contractor is requesting a change order, and you want guidance on how to respond.

## Key considerations
- What the signed scope of work explicitly includes
- Any allowances or exclusions listed in the contract
- Documentation of prior conversations or estimates

## Options and trade-offs
- Accept the change order if it’s clearly outside the written scope
- Negotiate pricing or scope if it conflicts with earlier written commitments
- Pause work until scope and cost are clarified in writing

## Suggested next steps
- Review the contract and proposal line items carefully
- Ask for a written breakdown of the electrical work and cost
- Document all decisions and approvals in writing

## Boundaries disclaimer
This is general advisory guidance based on the information provided. It does not replace on-site inspection, engineering, permitting, or legal advice.

## Assumptions
- There is a signed agreement with a defined scope of work.
- No urgent safety hazard exists.

## Escalation notes
- If the dispute escalates or involves legal claims, consult a local attorney.
