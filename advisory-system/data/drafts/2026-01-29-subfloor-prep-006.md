## Summary of the situation
You have a squeaky, slightly uneven subfloor and want to know if it should be leveled before installing LVP flooring.

## Key considerations
- Manufacturer flatness requirements for LVP
- Causes of squeaks (fastener issues, movement, or framing)
- Long-term risk of telegraphing or joint failure

## Options and trade-offs
- Level and secure the subfloor now to reduce future issues
- Spot-correct the dip if it’s localized and within tolerance

## Suggested next steps
- Check the LVP manufacturer’s flatness tolerance
- Identify and secure squeak areas with appropriate fasteners
- Use a straightedge to map low spots and plan leveling

## Boundaries disclaimer
This is general advisory guidance based on the information provided. It does not replace on-site inspection, engineering, permitting, or legal advice.

## Assumptions
- The subfloor is structurally sound with no active water damage.
- LVP is a floating installation, not glued down.

## Escalation notes
- If the dip suggests structural movement, consult a licensed professional.


## resolve sqeaks, dips ASAP, then level out and reinforce.
