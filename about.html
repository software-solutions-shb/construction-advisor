          <h2>Experience that translates to clear guidance</h2>
          <p>
            The advisory service draws on three decades of experience across residential
            construction, remodels, and kitchen planning. The goal is to help clients evaluate
            options, identify risks, and make informed decisions with confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The advice is structured, written, and calm—intended for homeowners and small
            contractors who want a grounded second opinion.
