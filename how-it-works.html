          A simple, structured process focused on clarity and next steps. You provide the
          context; you receive calm, practical guidance. This is advisory only—no inspection,
          certification, approval, or guarantees.

            This service provides general advisory guidance based on the information you provide.
            It does not replace licensed inspections, engineering analysis, permitting, or legal
            advice. No approvals, certifications, or guarantees are offered.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your situation requires an on-site assessment, you will be advised to engage a
            licensed professional in your jurisdiction.

            Response timing depends on the complexity of your question and the quality of

            an emergency service.
